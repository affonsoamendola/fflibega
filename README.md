# libEGA
--------------------
So, I decided to write a little C library for EGA graphics in DOS, since I want to use this graphics mode for my games.

The main idea is to make this as efficient as possible, really making it possible for use in games.

Hopefully I can channel my inner Abrash and make is as such.


Wish me luck
