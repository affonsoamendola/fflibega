# libEGA
--------------------
So, I decided to write a little C library for EGA graphics in DOS, since I want to use this graphics mode for my games.

The main idea is to make this as efficient as possible, really making it possible for use in games.

Hopefully I can channel my inner Abrash and make is as such.

As always, going to do the compiling with my copy of Turbo C 3.0, it has not failed me yet, when it does, i'll look at other options.

Wish me luck
