# Fofonso's VGA Library for DOS - fflibvga
--------------------

So, I decided to write a little C library for EGA graphics in DOS, since I want to use this graphics mode for my games.

The main idea is to make this as efficient as possible, really making it possible for use in games.

Hopefully I can channel my inner Abrash and make is as such.

As always, going to do the compiling with my copy of Turbo C 3.0, it has not failed me yet, when it does, i'll look at other options.

I sourced most of the information from the EGA technical manual from IBM, some of Abrash's articles on PJ (Man, that dude is a legend), and 
the EGARegisters.txt file I found lying somewhere on the internet, I'm not sure who made it but it's awesome, helped me alot, so if any of you
know who wrote it let me know so I can credit him/her.

It's mostly done, I'm not implementing some complex stuff that the EGA board is capable, like split screen and scrolling, since my game does not
use such features.

When I write something that does, I'll update this.


P.S.: I also included an 8x8 font I made for this, I call it Oldskewl, It's also distributed as GPLv3, so go nuts.
